## Geometric Vector Perceptron (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=1YLJDvSx6J4">Geometric Vector Perceptron</a>, a simple circuit for 3d rotation equivariance for learning over large biomolecules, in Pytorch. The repository may also contain experimentation to see if this could be easily extended to self-attention.
